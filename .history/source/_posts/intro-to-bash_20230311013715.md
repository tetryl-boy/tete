## Background

There are plenty of tutorials of linux and how to write a script. A computational chemist who needs to deal with countless input files and extract the information from the output files should have a good command of script writing. It will take days for an individual to finish one of those "completed" tutorial, but usually remember nothing in the end.

The more effecient way of learning scripting is to learn the most basic knowledge first and keep learning while practicing. This tutorial will focus on the basic tool you will need when doing some computational work. I will introduce you to scripting in
